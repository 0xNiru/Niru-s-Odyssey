# 🌌 Niru’s Odyssey

> A personal log of everything I’m building, breaking, feeling, and fixing.
> Logs from a mind that refuses to stay silent.

🧠 **This repo is not a portfolio.**  
It’s a diary. A debug log. A vent space. A space that’s mine.

👨‍💻 I’ll be pushing daily logs, thoughts, experiments, bug bounty writeups, and maybe a meme or two.

## 🧾 Manifesto

- No growth hacks. Just honest updates.
- Some days I’ll ship features.  
- Some days I’ll write 3 lines and cry.  
- Both are valid.

## 🪄 Why does this exist?

Because some thoughts deserve more than a tweet.  
Because Notion is too clean.  
Because public work creates public accountability.  
Because I don’t want to forget who I was while figuring out who I am.
